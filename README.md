**Title: Modernizing Your Asset Management: Extracting Assets and Metadata from MediaBin**

If you've landed on this page, chances are you're still managing your digital assets with the nearly two-decade-old  MediaBin system. While it may have served its purpose well, it's time to explore more modern solutions that offer enhanced features and flexibility.

Whether you're considering moving your assets to a more robust cloud storage solution like Amazon S3 or simply need to extract them for local management, having the right tools and scripts can make a world of difference.



**Extracting Assets and Metadata**

To aid in your transition, I've developed scripts that facilitate the extraction of assets and metadata from HP MediaBin. These scripts allow you to seamlessly transfer your digital content either to a local disk or directly to an Amazon S3 bucket, where they can be easily managed and accessed.

Hereâ€™s a high-level overview of how the scripts work:

1. **Asset and Metadata Retrieval**: The scripts connect to your HP MediaBin instance, iterating through containers and assets to retrieve files and associated metadata. This process is streamlined to ensure that all relevant information is extracted efficiently.

2. **Local Storage or Cloud Upload**: Once the assets are retrieved, you can choose to store them locally or upload them to an S3 bucket. The scripts are designed to handle both scenarios, giving you the flexibility to choose based on your needs.

3. **Logging and Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging ensures that any issues encountered during the extraction process are recorded, allowing for quick identification and resolution. Additionally, the scripts are equipped with robust error handling mechanisms to manage potential disruptions and ensure smooth execution.

**Expanding the Scripts**

The provided scripts are a starting point, and you can expand their functionality to suit your specific requirements. Whether it's integrating additional metadata fields, customizing file naming conventions, or automating post-processing tasks, the possibilities are vast.

**Conclusion**

If you're reading this, you're likely someone who recognizes the importance of staying ahead in the ever-evolving digital landscape. By modernizing your asset management approach, you position your organization for greater agility and success.

Transitioning away from HP MediaBin doesn't have to be daunting. With the right tools and scripts, you can ensure a smooth and efficient migration of your digital assets, unlocking new potential for your business.

### Scripts Overview

1. **`get_containers.py`**: Retrieves the list of containers from HP MediaBin.
2. **`get_assets.py`**: Retrieves the list of assets within a specified container.
3. **`retrieve_asset.py`**: Fetches individual asset files and their metadata.
4. **`main.py`**: Orchestrates the entire process, using the above modules to extract assets and save them to the local filesystem.
5. **`utility.py`**: Provides utility functions for sanitizing file paths and managing logs.

### Script Details

#### 1. `get_containers.py`

**Purpose**: This script connects to the HP MediaBin server and retrieves a list of all available containers. Containers are essentially folders that store assets, and this script lays the groundwork for accessing and managing those assets.

```python
# get_containers.py

def get_container_list():
    """
    Retrieves a list of containers from HP MediaBin.

    Returns:
        list: A list of dictionaries containing container details (e.g., id and name).
    """
    # Replace with actual implementation to connect to HP MediaBin and fetch containers
    containers = [
        {"id": "12345", "name": "Example Container"}
        # Add actual container retrieval logic here
    ]
    return containers
```

#### 2. `get_assets.py`

**Purpose**: This script fetches all assets from a specified container. It queries the MediaBin server for asset information, which includes file IDs and metadata references.

```python
# get_assets.py

def get_asset_list(container_id):
    """
    Retrieves a list of assets within a specified container from HP MediaBin.

    Args:
        container_id (str): The ID of the container.

    Returns:
        list: A list of dictionaries containing asset details (e.g., id, name, path).
    """
    # Replace with actual implementation to connect to HP MediaBin and fetch assets
    assets = [
        {"id": "abcde", "name": "Example Asset", "path": "Example Container/Asset"}
        # Add actual asset retrieval logic here
    ]
    return assets
```

#### 3. `retrieve_asset.py`

**Purpose**: This script handles the retrieval of asset files and their metadata from HP MediaBin. It uses asset IDs to fetch the file data and metadata associated with each asset.

```python
# retrieve_asset.py

def retrieve_file(asset_id):
    """
    Retrieves the file data for a specified asset from HP MediaBin.

    Args:
        asset_id (str): The ID of the asset.

    Returns:
        bytes: The binary data of the asset file.
    """
    # Replace with actual implementation to retrieve asset file data from HP MediaBin
    file_data = b"Example file data"
    return file_data

def get_asset_metadata(asset_id):
    """
    Retrieves the metadata for a specified asset from HP MediaBin.

    Args:
        asset_id (str): The ID of the asset.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing asset metadata (e.g., creator, resolution).
    """
    # Replace with actual implementation to retrieve asset metadata from HP MediaBin
    metadata = {
        "creator": "Example Creator",
        "resolution": "300x300"
    }
    return metadata
```

#### 4. `main.py`

**Purpose**: This is the main script that orchestrates the extraction process. It coordinates the retrieval of containers, assets, files, and metadata, and handles saving them to the local filesystem.

```python
# main.py

import os
import time
import json
from get_containers import get_container_list
from get_assets import get_asset_list
from retrieve_asset import retrieve_file, get_asset_metadata
from utility import log_failure, load_processed_assets, save_processed_assets, sanitize_filename, sanitize_path

LOG_FILE = "upload_log.json"
PROCESSED_FILE = "processed_assets.json"

def save_to_filesystem(file_data, file_name, asset_path, metadata):
    """Save the file and metadata to the local filesystem."""
    directory = os.path.join("output", sanitize_path(asset_path))
    os.makedirs(directory, exist_ok=True)

    file_path = os.path.join(directory, sanitize_filename(file_name))
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
        file.write(file_data)
    print(f"Saved file to {file_path}")

    metadata_path = file_path + '.metadata'
    with open(metadata_path, 'w') as metadata_file:
        json.dump(metadata, metadata_file, indent=4)
    print(f"Saved metadata to {metadata_path}")

def process_assets(container, processed_assets):
    """Process all assets in a given container."""
    asset_data = get_asset_list(container['id'])

    if asset_data:
        for asset in asset_data:
            if asset['id'] in processed_assets:
                print(f"Skipping already processed asset: {asset['name']} (ID: {asset['id']})")
                continue

            print(f"Processing asset: {asset['name']} (ID: {asset['id']})")
            
            try:
                file_data = retrieve_file(asset['id'])
            except Exception as e:
                error_message = f"Failed to retrieve file for asset {asset['id']}. Error: {str(e)}"
                print(error_message)
                log_failure(asset['id'], asset['name'], error_message)
                continue

            if file_data:
                metadata = get_asset_metadata(asset['id'])
                save_to_filesystem(file_data, asset['name'], asset['path'], metadata)

                processed_assets.add(asset['id'])
                save_processed_assets(processed_assets)
                
                time.sleep(1)
    else:
        print("No assets found in this container.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    processed_assets = load_processed_assets()
    containers = get_container_list()

    if containers:
        for container in containers:
            print(f"\nProcessing container: {container['name']} (ID: {container['id']})")
            process_assets(container, processed_assets)
    else:
        print("No containers found.")
```

#### 5. `utility.py`

**Purpose**: This script provides utility functions to support logging, path sanitization, and handling processed assets. It ensures clean file operations and tracking of progress.

```python
# utility.py

import os
import json

LOG_FILE = "upload_log.json"
PROCESSED_FILE = "processed_assets.json"

def sanitize_filename(filename):
    """Sanitize a filename to remove invalid characters."""
    return ''.join(c for c in filename if c.isalnum() or c in (' ', '.', '_', '-')).strip()

def sanitize_path(path):
    """Sanitize a path to ensure proper directory structure."""
    return path.replace('\\', '/').strip('/')

def log_failure(asset_id, asset_name, error_message):
    """Log the failed asset and error message to a log file."""
    log_entry = {"asset_id": asset_id, "asset_name": asset_name, "error": error_message}
    with open(LOG_FILE, 'a') as log_file:
        log_file.write(json.dumps(log_entry) + '\n')

def load_processed_assets():
    """Load the list of processed assets from the file."""
    if os.path.exists(PROCESSED_FILE):
        with open(PROCESSED_FILE, 'r') as file:
            return set(json.load(file))
    return set()

def save_processed_assets(processed_assets):
    """Save the list of processed assets to the file."""
    with open(PROCESSED_FILE, 'w') as file:
        json.dump(list(processed_assets), file)
```
